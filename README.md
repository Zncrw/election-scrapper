# Instaling Libraries :
here i used conda, base instalation of this pack is already everything what you need for this project.  All used libraries on this project you can find in requirements.txt file.
Conda can be installed from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/ . There are some useful commands when working with conda :
conda create --name new_env   - create new env  
conda activate new_env        - activate already existing env   
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib - with this comand you can install all libraries you need.
